# Resume:

This is an resume application that is intended to load dynamically from a provided JSON. 
An HTML template is created as part of this application and all the JSON data is loaded dynamically
Developed with mobile-first perspective


## Concepts Implemented:
* *HTML Canvas*
* *Object Oriented Javascript*
* BootStrap

## Steps to run
* Download the repository and launch the ```index.html``` . Alternatively, navigate to this [link](https://gvsvarun.github.io/resume/)

## How to generate your own resume
* Navigate to ``` data``` folder and look at one of the many JSON's that are available and try to create a similar JSON file with your specific data.
* Now modify the location of the file in ```app.js``` and open  ```soAndSo``` function and modify the url path and direct it to your JSON file
* Let the magic begin

## TODO
* Use a build tool
* Integrate unit testing to make sure that the functionalities are not modified
* Deploy using CI/CD tasks
* Create a page to generate a dynamic JSON and then parse it to the resume dynamically
